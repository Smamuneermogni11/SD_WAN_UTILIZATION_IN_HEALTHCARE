I.	INTRODUCTION 
The healthcare industry has evolved significantly over recent years in technology and business. Healthcare organizations have adopted a wide array of innovative technologies to improve healthcare in telemedicine, diagnostics, treatment, and medical records. Healthcare organizations have also been consolidating metropolitan academic centers, regional clinics, and rural practices. Lastly, the COVID pandemic also accelerated the adoption of additional technology options for patients and providers. In addition, COVID significantly increased the radius for where and when healthcare providers and patients will need access to these technologies. However, these changes will substantially improve patient quality of care across large metropolitan medical centers, urgent care centers, testing centers, and rural offices.
To adjust to the rapidly evolving environment, healthcare organizations need to leverage digital transformation to effectively provide access, processes, and IT infrastructure to deliver an enhanced experience to patients. Electronic medical records (EMR), access to cloud-based applications, and a wide array of connected IoT devices assist healthcare professionals in providing higher levels of service. The latest technologies facilitate virtual or telemedicine and for healthcare workers to collect, analyze, and access data about a patient’s well-being via remote monitoring. Each healthcare organization relies on its IT infrastructure and environment to facilitate this digital transformation, which is vital for connecting to cloud applications, centralizing, and accessing medical records, supporting mobile testing centers, transmitting diagnostic images, and other protected health information between patients and their healthcare providers.
In addition to increasing operational efficiency and improving the patient experience, healthcare organizations also need to minimize risk and ensure security. However, they need to overcome the challenge of connecting the healthcare organization’s cloud applications and data centers to distributed clinics, rural practices, testing sites, and urgent care centers in a secure network. Furthermore, the healthcare organization network needs to connect people’s homes reliably and securely as the industry rapidly adopts telemedicine and virtual care. The high reliance on outdated internet service provider networks further complicates these challenges.
The challenges faced in the organizations undergoing digital transformations include:  
A.	Increasing complexity of IT environment:
Healthcare organizations are modernizing their IT environment to support new applications and facilitate remote work. There is a rapid increase in applications that make use of modern architectures in a highly regulated industry where privacy and security are critical.
B.	Geographically dispersed locations:
Healthcare facilities in large cities are usually very adequately connected with sufficient bandwidth. However, these facilities need to link their metropolitan network to urgent care centers, regional clinics, rural practices, and physician/patient homes. All these locations not only need to connect to their network reliably but to cloud applications and services while maintaining consistent performance and experience across all these locations.
C.	Legacy network infrastructure:
Healthcare organizations are still working with legacy network environments that are costly, rigid, and not scalable, making it challenging to deliver consistent and reliable service across distributed facilities and offices while keeping expansion costs low.
D.	Compliance with industry regulations:
In today's fast-growing healthcare industry many companies need to adhere to laws and regulations strictly. Organizations need to follow HIPAA privacy rules to ensure that individuals’ health information is appropriately the data is provided to provide better and more efficient quality to the patients and preserve and protect the data from being breached [22].
In addition, the HITECH Act (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act) was created in 2009 to drive the adoption of EMRs by healthcare providers. The HITECH Act also introduced stricter penalties for HIPAA compliance violations to incentivize Healthcare organizations to comply with HIPAA privacy and security regulations [23].
E.	Security considerations due to diverse WAN traffic:
Healthcare organizations must be able to distinguish electronic data traffic generated from a wide array of devices (including IoT devices, laptops, tablets, phones, etc.), EMRs, and cloud applications. This vast number of connected devices creates more opportunities for cyberattacks, security breaches, and denial-of-service ransomware attacks, potentially leaving a hospital unable to provide patient care. They need to differentiate between private data such as medical images and telemedicine video calls and public data such as patients on guest networks browsing the internet in waiting rooms. Financial information is a significant part of the data exchanges between patients, healthcare organizations, and insurance companies. All facilities, including remote locations in the organization’s network, need to perform these functions while staying compliant with regulations securely [24]. 
F.	Ensuring data availability:
Healthcare providers need to regularly access and update centralized patient medical records. Therefore, metropolitan, and regional centers rely on the WAN for data availability which is a challenge and risk for remote locations as they may only have a single network link [25]. 
II.	SD WAN

A novel approach to network design is SD-WAN. SD-WAN allows the merging of multiple Internet connections at one location into one. To provide better performance and get faster speeds and better failover without paying a local carrier for dedicated connections [12].
Traditional WAN networks cannot adequately address these challenges. Software-Defined Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN) can provide a viable solution for healthcare organizations operating local hardware and software but now need to cater to their expanding footprint. SD-WAN is a virtual WAN architecture that enables organizations to use any combination of transport services, including MPLS, LTE, and broadband to securely connect users to applications. An SD-WAN uses centralized software to securely and intelligently control traffic among data centers, branch offices, and cloud-based services. This approach increases application performance and delivers a high-quality user experience, improving business productivity and agility and reducing IT costs [26].
Due to the constant need for security, availability, and real-time processing, customers in the healthcare industry rely largely on a lightning-fast network. Because the Internet of Things is the new way to run businesses, and things like surgeries are being enhanced with machines and illnesses are being diagnosed on the spot with databases, a real-time network is the only way for physicians to get the performance they need [13].
For today’s market, the software-defined wide area network offers two benefits: it facilitates the development of centralized control applications reflecting application-specific requirements to ensure the user-perceived quality of experience. Furthermore, it provides an inherent programmatic framework for creating hosting control applications, which are developed centralized, considering the application-level requirements to ensure the QoE (Quality of Experience) is perceived by users. Second, without requiring manual configuration at each device, it may create network policies and govern network traffic from a central point [13].
III.	HOW SD WAN WORKS:
In a faster-growing environment, many consumers demand Quality of Experience, and finding solutions to meet the consumers' demands for total satisfaction of the user is quite tough. Software-defined wide area network is one of the most popular and rapidly expanding solutions to provide better and improve their overall quality of experience. The major goal of the SD-WAN is to replace the old WAN technology, simplify network operations, generate innovations, and improve the technology's performance [2] [3]. 

A.	Benefits of SD-WAN over the traditional WAN:
The most significant distinction is that the new generation of SD-WAN decreases human mistakes produced by traditional WAN programming, which is time-consuming and difficult. SD-WAN makes it easier to implement policies that rely on virtualized overlays and can be handled remotely through the controller. Through cloud-based services, SD-WAN delivers more powerful VPN connections to provide Quality of Service and better security [36].

B.	Comparing SD-WAN and MPLs: 
 
MPLs were once commonly utilized as a VPN in the healthcare business but owing to the rise of cloud-based services, they are now seldom employed and unable to meet the criteria of this technology.

However, due to the covid epidemic, everything changed, making it harder to operate in remote areas. Fortunately, numerous cloud-based firms provided solutions, allowing health care organizations to profit and get back on track with connecting with their patients. As a result, most businesses understood that SD-WAN may bring several benefits, as a pandemic they will be charged a lot of money. Many businesses have switched to SD-WAN since it is more cost-effective and provides more capacity. When compared to standard MPLs, application performance rose, and SD-WAN brought several benefits.

IV.	ARCHITECTURE:  

A.	Network or Data Layer:
Enterprise sites may be analyzed as diverse components such as enterprise branches, headquarters, and cloud-based IT infrastructure if we create a network layer thinking in terms of services. The devices that are used to interconnect WANs at various locations are classed as the first kind in the network layer, while intermediate WANs are classified as the second. When we look at the network function, we can see that it is separated into two types: underlay and overlay networks [5] [35]. 

•	Underlay and Overlay Network: This illustrates how the underlay network maintains a WAN built by its carriers, but the overlay network, often known as virtualization technology, establishes several layers over a single underlying network. The various tiers can provide various services to one or more tenants [35].
•	Edge: In SD-WAN, two primary components are utilized to build the network layer: EDGE and gateway. In some cases, VAS devices are also installed for specific service requirements. An enterprise SD WANs site's edge is travel equipment that is retained at the customer's physical location. To guarantee network resilience, a site might have two edges. To protect the network line, which acts as the SD WAN's endpoints. To protect the network line, IPsec is utilized as a data encryption method [35].
•	A gateway is a device that links existing VPNs to the overlay network. So, if we see the new SD WANs put in the network, they must first connect to the previous version websites or third-party services to learn how they operate. Older websites are frequently connected to older WANs, whereas newer SD WANs are connected to overlay tunnels. As a result, it is unable to converse directly with one another. As a result, a gateway may be utilized as a particular edge that an SDN controller can handle [35].
B.	Control Layer: 
The SDN Controller is the most crucial component and functions as the brain of the SD-WAN system. SDN controller has numerous roles, including network orchestration, control, and administration [35].
•	Network Orchestration: This component oversees minimizing network model and configuration complexity. All the network models that have been configured are simple to utilize [35].  
•	Network Control: This is the most important component in the network layer since it controls and executes on-demand operations. Distributing and filtering VPN, as well as constructing and altering VPN topologies, are some of the services available. Overlay tunnels linking sites and gateways are built and maintained [35]. 
•	 Network Management: This component collects and analyzes various sorts of data. It assesses applications and networks based on performance and dependability. When these components aren't connected, it's easier for developers to rectify data, alter it, and eliminate faults at a cheap cost [35].
C.	Application Layer: 
•	Service or application layer: There are two types of service interfaces created by the link between the service layer and the SDN controller. E2E, or end-to-end service, is one of the forms of SD-WAN solution that supports setup and provisioning operations. SDN controller may be coupled with third-party software that can re-design the portal based on user needs and data display. Typically, this layer aids in the translation of complicated arrangements into understandable language. This layer can assist the provider and developers govern the network by providing techniques for constructing an application in the underlying WAN [35].

 
Fig 1: How SD-WAN works
SD-WAN is a growing technology that has been used by every business and organization to connect to their branches and other cloud applications. To summarize the material, the SD-WAN includes a wide range of features, including virtualization, centralized policy and orchestration, and traffic management. So, if clearing the MPL's traffic demands is expensive, SD-WAN provides the greatest option of low-cost links, such as internet circuits.
SD-WAN has advantages in a variety of ways, including network flexibility and scalability, as well as WAN configuration management and maintenance [36].
 
V.	BENEFITS OF SD-WAN TO HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS 

As the environment around healthcare organizations continues to grow and evolve, SD-WAN can support its networks in a few keyways.
A.	Security and HIPAA Compliance:
SD-WAN enables secure connectivity across locations by encrypting traffic across broadband and MPLS connections. In addition, it can establish secure connections to rural areas where broadband may be the only connectivity available by utilizing next-generation firewalls to eliminate gaps in protection. SD-WAN also automates many processes, which help with HIPAA compliance and security [30].
B.	Efficiency in Network Provisioning:
SD-WAN provides healthcare organizations with efficiencies in their operations and costs by automating several processes to ensure that the network adapts to adjusting requirements. Increased network traffic can tax bandwidth, but SD-WAN can handle this issue by rerouting traffic and balancing loads so crucial applications can continue to perform effectively. 

The ability to manage policy and configuration centrally with SD-WAN allows healthcare organizations to significantly reduce the time needed to get a new site up and running. SD-WANs can configure new sites remotely and sometimes automatically once they are connected. Furthermore, centralized control and monitoring enable healthcare organizations to detect and mitigate network problems, shift workloads, or make global policy changes. For example, a network engineer can do this with a few mouse clicks on a user-friendly interface compared to connecting to each device at each location to issue a series of commands to make changes [31].
C.	Reliability and Improved Patient Care:
Healthcare organizations must prevent outages and network downtime to minimize patient risk. SD-WAN provides resiliency and reliability through network redundancy. SD-WAN solutions allow for automatic failover and have built-in tools such as load sharing and link balancing to maintain business continuity [30].

SD-WAN technologies use a combination of fixed and broadband connections to prevent outages. Traffic can be divided across these links based on priority. The most critical applications, such as telemedicine applications with latency-sensitive voice and video, are given priority, thus ensuring that patient care and financial transactions will continue uninterrupted even in situations with degraded performance. It may also mean that traffic is shifted to an alternate route if the current one can’t support the defined performance requirements. Advanced SD-WAN providers leverage self-aware systems with artificial intelligence or machine learning to continuously monitor performance and automatically rebalance traffic across broadband and LTE links based on the assigned policy or performance requirement, saving time and ensuring the best possible experience for end-users. In contrast, end-users would complain to IT in the event of a degraded link, who would open a ticket with the service provider, who would investigate to attempt to fix the problem. This process might take hours at best—and days or weeks at worst [31].
VI.	CASE STUDY: ACCESSIBILITY HEALTHCARE PROVIDER WRIGHT & FILIPPIS REHAB THEIR LEGACY NETWORK & VOICE SYSTEMS

A.	Challenges:
The accessible health care provider, in this case, study tackled various difficulties, including network resiliency, because most businesses are ignorant of how their networks function on a regular basis. As a result, resilience apps back up the infrastructure and assist in data storage even if there are certain faults. There were also many power outages, which caused faults in the hospital's fundamental system. Some of the hospital's critical services, which rely on a constant power supply, were disrupted, causing problems for patients. Other concerns included sluggish program performance, which resulted in inadequate bandwidth, as well as hardware and firewall issues. It created interruptions in voice-enabled devices, and a lack of precision and misunderstanding is a key contributor in low QoE Quality of Experience.
B.	Windstream Enterprise Solutions & Results:
Windstream Enterprise Solutions provided Wright & Filippis with an SD-WAN, an ideal solution to their bandwidth and uptime challenges. The SD-WAN could support the company's bandwidth challenges while still allowing the clinics to function as customer-serving businesses. The SD-WAN solution provided automatic failover from dual, active/active connections features and its ability to prioritize existing bandwidth to critical applications. In addition, fiber and cable connections gave the healthcare organization's network the resiliency to significantly reduce outages while allowing the network administrators to optimize the company's EMR performance [37].

Windstream Enterprise Solutions' Office Suite UC® enabled Wright & Filippis' customers and employees to stay connected and collaborate from anywhere, across different devices via voice calls, chat, video conferencing, and SMS text messaging through a secure, cloud-based system. Office Suite UC® was also highly flexible and could easily scale to ~20,000 users. The SD-WAN also allowed Wright & Filippis to protect their network by adding an extra layer of network fortification that unified firewall, content filtering, intrusion prevention, application control, and security information and event management solutions. Furthermore, the SD-WAN allowed remote sites to connect to the network through a secure VPN [37].

Lastly, Wright & Filippis's network administrators and employees could easily make changes to the system from a user-friendly portal. The SD-WAN solution enabled network administrators to do the following:
-       Manage and configure all services from a single place (computer, tablet, or smartphone)
-       Make real-time changes based on real-time performance
-       Implement immediate call routing and voicemail changes
-       Set business policies, prioritize applications, and customize the naming and tagging of devices and destinations
-       Customize dashboards to allow employees to self-manage features [37].

C.	Results:  
MPL's Network had experienced network disruptions, with the network being down daily, making it impossible to service patients. Troubleshooting is aided by the We Connect site. Application performance that is faster With SD WAN concierge, Wright and Fillips were able to supply fiber and cables with complete connection, allowing for a speedier application process. A more pleasant call center experiences the number of voice outages has decreased. Installation of UCaaS solutions has been completed. Because there is only one source, the cost of maintenance is also minimized [37].
VII.	CONCLUSION 

Software-Defined Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN) enhances security and HIPAA compliance, promotes efficiency in network provisioning through automated processes, facilitates applications that improve patient care and customer satisfaction as well as decreases the burden on healthcare administration. These positive adaptations are obtained through many mechanisms, including expanded bandwidth, improved application performance, reduced network outages, consolidated service providers, and improved patient experience. In a rapidly changing healthcare industry, SD-WAN affords flexibility for secure connections with many applications from a variety of devices for both staff and patients. By using SD-WAN healthcare organizations can overcome connectivity challenges at remote and rural sites, as well as patient homes, despite antiquated technology or infrastructures.
